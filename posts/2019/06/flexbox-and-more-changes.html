      <p>So, just last week I was saying a bunch of changes I had made, well, this is not gonna be as long, it's just some little updates.</p>

      <h3>New layout (again)</h3>

        <source srcset="/images/webp/posts-flex-page.webp" type="image/webp" />
        <source srcset="/images/jpg/posts-flex-page.jpg" type="image/jpeg" />

      <p>Yes, as you see, and as you probably saw to see this article. A new tweak for the
      layout, on desktops, you get more space used which is pretty good, really. I'm not
      sure how I like how it messes a little bit with how linear it was but it works
      and it's still quite easy to manage.</p>

      <h3>Related pages</h3>
      <p>I'm not sure what to say, I'm putting articles at the bottom of articles so people
      can discover new content from other people or my older content. Kind of similar to webrings
      but well, more curated in a way.</p>

      <h3>Mistakes</h3>
      <p>I'm quite scared and stressed about this but I do want to let it out. It'll take time
      and courage but I'll do it.</p>

      <h3>More appropriate links</h3>
      <p>Old links will be broken, sorry about that but I think the new ones better fit the content.</p>

      <p>Anyways, I'll try to stop redesigning so much and creating so much meta content. Sorry.</p>
