        <p>So I've not updated this blog in a while but in the last few days I've updated it a bunch!
        So here's some of the key changes from this.</p>

        <h3>Biggest change probably : No more comments!</h3>

        <p>So you might've thought it was about toxicity in comments or something about
        the ethics of it... It wasn't used much either or well, I should say, I never saw it
        being used.</p>

        <div class="blog-post-picture">
          <img src="/images/comments.webp"></img>
          <div class="blog-picture-text"><a href="https://lionirdeadman.neocities.org/about.html" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></div>
        </div>

        <p>But well, it's a lot simpler than that, the service seems to be no more.
        I contacted the admin and there was no response, it's possible that the email service is also dead but well,
        it's gone for now atleast.</p>

        <h3>Licensing</h3>
        <p>So I did quite a bit of changes relating to work licenses, I already had the code under AGPLv3 as per <a href="21-05-2018.html">my blog post</a>
        but well, I have more changes.</p>

        <h4>Proper license notice for artwork</h4>
        <p>Now all of the artwork I use has the license terms and a link to the source for attribution! The github also has LICENSES files
        to make this easier for those who are seeing from there. I'm pretty happy with how that looks too.</p>

        <h4>Licensing my text as CC BY-SA 4.0</h4>
        <p>Now all of the text is under CC BY-SA 4.0 which is noted at the end of each article
        so this change is pretty self-explanatory..</p>

        <h3>New styling</h3>

        <div class="blog-post-picture">
          <img src="/images/posts-page.webp"></img>
          <div class="blog-picture-text"><a href="https://lionirdeadman.neocities.org/about.html" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="picture-description">
          <p>Just a screenshot of the page to show it off.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I've done some few changes with the design, <a href="../posts.html">the posts page</a> is more minimalist
        and more similar to the mobile view, I like it.</p>

        <p>As you may have seen too, there's a dark theme too! It works using "prefers-color-scheme: dark" which <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8840/dark-mode-support-in-webkit/" target="_blank">Safari</a>,
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=889087" target="_blank">Chromium</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1494034" target="_blank">Firefox</a> respect based
        on your operating system settings or an internal setting</p>

        <p>There's also new navigation changes which can be seen at the top for easier than
        before way to switch views.</p>

        <h3>Metadata changes</h3>
        <div class="blog-post-picture">
          <img src="/images/discord_embed.webp"></img>
          <div class="blog-picture-text"><a href="https://lionirdeadman.neocities.org/about.html" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="picture-description">
          <p>Just a screenshot of a discord embed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post-picture">
          <img src="/images/twit_embed.webp"></img>
          <div class="blog-picture-text"><a href="https://lionirdeadman.neocities.org/about.html" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="picture-description">
          <p>Just a screenshot of a twitter embed.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now when websites need to embed the website, we give them the usual web author and description,
        we give OpenGraph metadata and Twitter metadata which should let them to have good embeds and previews for the content!</p>

        <h3>Switch to Webp</h3>
        <p>I put all the pictures from .pngs and .jpgs to .webps which reduced the size from there
        over five times (432kb to 2.9mb)!</p>
