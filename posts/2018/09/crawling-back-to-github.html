      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Crawling back to Github..</h2>

      <p>I'm really sad. My code contributions have been quite low and I haven't worked as much
      as I wish I did, my code's been relatively untouched in the last months even though
      I need to modify it. But I'm also sad that my switch to Gitlab has not been as smooth
      as I wish it had been.</p>

      <p>First of all, the most frustrating part is how Gitlab handles watching and the lack of
      notifications unlike Github. This makes me watch my repositories manually most of the time
      which is quite frustrating. I really hope they work on this.</p>

      <p>I would switch to something which does have notifications like for example
      <a href="https://gitbucket.github.io/">Gitbucket</a> but I have no hosting place to do this
      so it's an impossibility at the moment. Maybe somebody else can offer it to me until I can
      use a VPS of my own</p>

      <p>I really hate to do this but notifications is something I really need out of my
      git platform. *sighs*</p>
