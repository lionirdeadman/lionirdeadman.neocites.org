      but that's another story, hopefully it improves. Feel free to contribute!</p>

      <p>I may have broken some things with some of the changes I did but I think it's okay. At least, when I tested
      locally, who knows what'll happen once this thing goes on Neocities. Hopefully nothing otherwise that'd suck.</p>

      <p>I'm still waiting for someone to actually comment on here which kind of stinks, I was hoping for people to do so!
      Who are those 1660 (at the time of this writing) people who saw this blog? What do they think? It really interests me.</p>

      <p>Anyhow, that's off-topic and so, I'll just end this blog post here. Oh, right! The source code is <a href="https://gitlab.com/Lionirdeadman/lionirdeadman.neocities.org">here</a>
      I may have a mirror on Github later, maybe, we'll see if anyone wants me to do so. Well, that's all I had to say, have a good day y'all!</p>
