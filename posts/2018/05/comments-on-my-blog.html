      <p>Okay so I've been thinking about the best way for people reading my blog to contact me and I think I've found
      a solution which is pretty good.. comments! Okay, here's why that's a good way.</p>

      <h3>1. Control</h3>
      <p>With the comment system in place, I don't have a contact page but that's good, you'll just comment and put your email
      address and other ways I can contact you there and then I can contact you when I want, this means that I won't risk getting
      spammed as much.</p>

      <h3>2. Privacy</h3>
      <p>The messages will not be public until I approve them so if you give me your contact information inside the comment, I'll simply
      delete it and it'll never be seen by other people.</p>

      <h3>3. Just.. comments!</h3>
      <p>If you post a comment regarding the article / blog post, I'll approve it and people
      will be able to see it and reply to you. I think it'll be really cool to see what you all think of this and it won't
      feel like I'm talking to myself anymore, haha.</p>

      <p>Oh! I almost forgot, the javascript and third-party service provider will not be loaded until you click
      the "Show comments" button so you can still read it without a third-party snooping on you.</p>
