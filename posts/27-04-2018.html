        <div class="blog-post-title">Why am I using Neocities?</div>

        <p>Well, for one, it's free. "Okay, and?", you may be saying. I don't have the burden of hosting.
        I can simply code away the html and not worry about anything else..</p>

        <blockquote>"This gives me freedom and peace of mind."</blockquote>

          <div class="blog-picture-text"><a href="https://lionirdeadman.neocities.org/about.html" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></div>
        </div>

        <div class="picture-description">
          <p> Just a screenshot of the neocities homepage because I can... </p>
        </div>

        <p>Not only that but since there's no database or anything, just static files.
        I've also further restricted myself by not using javascript (although that may change)</p>

        <p>Why? Because the web is bloated and it takes way too long to load most
        pages and they're just filled with ads, trackers, javascript and other crap.</p>

        <p>So I'm just gonna post from here from time to time some decently-sized posts..
        You can also subsribe to the <a href="https://lionirdeadman.neocities.org/atom.xml">rss</a> to see whenever I post something
        on here without making an account and stuff.</p>
